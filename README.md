I have wanted to learn Idris for quite some time, in fact I have gotten pretty far into the documentation a couple of times, but I never got around to play with it.

But this time I am committed. I am so committed that I am going to keep a repository of my efforts for the world to see, and I encourage you to call me names if I appear to be procrastinating judging by my commit history.
